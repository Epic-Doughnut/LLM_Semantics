"Right from the start, readers know that Alice McKinney is something special. In this, her very first book, Alice is in sixth grade, right on the cusp of adolescence and increasingly anxious about growing up in a household with no other females.

The Sterkarm Handshake
15
"Beware of shaking hands with a Sterkarm!" goes the folk saying. Why the warning? The members of this wild 16th-century Scottish clan are left-handed, and while they smile and offer the right hand, the left wields a dagger.<p> When a 21st-century mega-corporation opens a Time Tube to the 16th century, the stiff-backed CEO finds his plans for exploiting the mineral and tourism possibilities of the ancient English-Scottish border frustrated by the Sterkarms--raiding parties of men he regards as primitive animals.</p><p> On the other side of the Time Tube, anthropologist Andrea Mitchell has been sent to live with the Sterkarms to be the corporation's informant and translator. There she is surprised to find herself admired for her generous curves and accepted warmly by the volatile and affectionate--but intermittently murderous--clansmen. When her lover, Per, is grievously wounded on a raid, she persuades Old Toorkild, the chief, to allow his handsome and adored son to be transported to the 21st century for healing. But when Per awakes in a world four centuries ahead of his own, his terror and suspicions of treachery bring down a wild collision between heartless technology and a ferocious people skilled in passionate defense of their life and lands.</p><p> Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize in England, Susan Price's <i>The Sterkarm Handshake</i>--a richly textured love story, a vivid and sometimes humorous portrayal of confrontation between cultures, and a thumping good page-turner--should find enthusiastic fans among teen-fantasy and time-travel buffs.

Notes from a Small Island
16
"<b>""Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain-which is to say, all of it.""</b><br /><br />After nearly two decades spent on British soil, Bill Bryson - bestselling author of <i>The Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>-decided to return to the United States. (""I had recently read,"" Bryson writes, ""that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, so it was clear that my people needed me."") But before departing, he set out on a grand farewell tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home.<br /><br />Veering from the ludicrous to the endearing and back again, <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> is a delightfully irreverent jaunt around the unparalleled floating nation that has produced zebra crossings, Shakespeare, Twiggie Winkie's Farm, and places with names like Farleigh Wallop and Titsey. The result is an uproarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain, from the satiric pen of an unapologetic Anglophile."
