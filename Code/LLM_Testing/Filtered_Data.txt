million teens and young adults through his playful, sweet, and
inspirational YouTube presence. Already a bestselling author with his
memoir, In Real Life, Joey now presents his first novel, Children of Eden.
Rowan is a second child in a world where population control measures make
her an outlaw, marked for death. She can never go to school, make friends,
or get the eye implants that will mark her as a true member of Eden.
Indeed, her kaleidoscopic eyes may very well give her away to the ruthless
Center government. Outside of Eden, Earth is poisoned and dead. All animals
and most plants have been destroyed by a man-made catastrophe. Long ago,
the brilliant scientist Aaron Al-Baz saved a pocket of civilization by
designing the EcoPanopticon, a massive computer program that hijacked all
global technology and put it to use preserving the last vestiges of
mankind. Humans will wait for thousands of years in Eden until the EcoPan
heals the world. As an illegal second child, Rowan has been hidden away in
her family’s compound for sixteen years. Now, desperate to see the world,
she recklessly escapes for what she swears will be only one night of
adventure. Though she finds an exotic world, and even a friend, the night
leads to tragedy. Soon Rowan becomes a renegade on the run. The first novel
from YouTube superstar Joey Graceffa, Children of Eden is a thrilling and
completely absorbing new book from one of social media’s brightest young
storytellers.",278,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7878669-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.08733337202778262, 'Anticipation': 0.15547429721206493, 'Disgust': 0.05713235436376651, 'Fear': 0.13086462746918953, 'Joy': 0.232147348462863, 'Sadness': 0.09569137307253274, 'Surprise': 0.05939597964671967, 'Trust': 0.18196064774508103}","{'Anger': 0.03250779567762983, 'Anticipation': 0.060795483187982065, 'Disgust': 0.02126617648117875, 'Fear': 0.04871128266803017, 'Joy': 0.08303386888858483, 'Sadness': 0.039896585745252386, 'Surprise': 0.02210875780467957, 'Trust': 0.07234676902469413, 'Objective': 0.6193332805219685}"

any of us who want a better understanding of Hillary Clinton, this book is
an excellent place to start.” —Bob Schieffer, CBS News As a young girl,
Hillary Diane Rodham’s parents told her she could be whatever she wanted--
as long as she was willing to work for it. Hillary took those words and
ran. In a life on the front row of modern American history, she has always
stood out--whether she was a teen campaigning for the 1964 Republican
presidential candidate, winning recognition in Life magazine for her
pointed words as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley
College, or working on the Richard Nixon impeachment case as a newly minted
lawyer. For all her accomplishments, scrutiny and scandal have followed
this complex woman since she stepped into the public eye—from her role as
First Lady of Arkansas to First Lady of the United States to becoming the
first female U.S. senator from New York to U.S. secretary of state. Despite
intense criticism, Hillary has remained committed to public service and
dedicated to health-care reform, children's issues, and women’s rights.
Now, she aspires to a bigger role: her nation's first woman president. In
Hillary Rodham Clinton: A Woman Living History, critically acclaimed author
Karen Blumenthal gives us an intimate and unflinching look at the public
and personal life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Illustrated throughout with
black-and-white photographs and political cartoons, this is a must-have
biography about a woman who has fascinated--and divided--the public, who
continues to push boundaries, and who isn’t afraid to reach for one more
goal. The paperback is revised and updated with chapters about the 2016
presidential campaign and election. Praise for Hillary Rodham Clinton: A
Woman Living History: ""After decades in the public eye, Hillary Rodham
Clinton is still an enigma, as Blumenthal (Tommy: The Gun That Changed
America) emphasizes in this compelling portrait of the former U.S. Senator
and Secretary of State’s journey from budding activist to presidential
aspirant."" —Publishers Weekly, starred review ""Thorough and evenhanded. . .
. Blumenthal, a longtime Wall Street Journal reporter, is part of a current
wave of narrative nonfiction authors who write for teenagers with such
directness and clarity that adult readers, too, may gain a deeper
understanding. . . . Providing nuanced but clear explanations for the ways
Hillary’s personality and personal history have shaped her political career
is where Blumenthal’s method really pays off."" —The New York Times",472,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpy_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"{'Anger': 0.055050933786078095, 'Anticipation': 0.19628607809847198, 'Disgust': 0.027037351443123938, 'Fear': 0.08251273344651952, 'Joy': 0.24571307300509335, 'Sadness': 0.04567062818336163, 'Surprise': 0.048896434634974534, 'Trust': 0.2988327674023769}","{'Anger': 0.012767381653164283, 'Anticipation': 0.053289298827605885, 'Disgust': 0.006270487365509366, 'Fear': 0.01913630681091084, 'Joy': 0.058403142134328206, 'Sadness': 0.011669800269719552, 'Surprise': 0.011340033665724945, 'Trust': 0.07407443865848976, 'Objective': 0.753049110614547}"

Nadja just doesn't understand Zara's creative passion for, and self-expression through, photography. And Zara doesn't know how to reach beyond their differences and connect to a closed-off mother who refuses to speak about her past in Bosnia. But when a bomb explodes as they're shopping in their local farmers' market in Rhode Island, Zara is left with PTSD--and her mother is left in a coma. Without the opportunity to get to know her mother, Zara is left with questions--not just about her mother, but about faith, religion, history, and her own path forward.   As Zara tries to sort through her confusion, she meets Joseph, whose grandmother is also in the hospital, and whose exploration of religion and philosophy offer comfort and insight into Zara's own line of thinking.   Told in chapters that alternate between Zara's present-day Providence, RI, and Nadja's own childhood in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War of the 1990s, We Are All That's Left shows the ways in which, no matter the time and place, struggle and tragedy can give way to connection, healing and love.",376,,"{'Anger': 0.06685096153846153, 'Anticipation': 0.14947115384615386, 'Disgust': 0.012211538461538461, 'Fear': 0.130625, 'Joy': 0.16795673076923076, 'Sadness': 0.105, 'Surprise': 0.053701923076923064, 'Trust': 0.31418269230769225}","{'Anger': 0.02894191842978905, 'Anticipation': 0.07008086253369274, 'Disgust': 0.005286765394582106, 'Fear': 0.0663551499131014, 'Joy': 0.067832946539146, 'Sadness': 0.056530924455452755, 'Surprise': 0.03299024862367181, 'Trust': 0.14122324095369918, 'Objective': 0.530757943156865}"

Books of the Year “This gut-wrenching, poetic memoir reminds us that no
life story can be reduced to the word ‘refugee.’"" —New York Times Book
Review “A critical piece of literature, contributing to the larger refugee
narrative in a way that is complex and nuanced.” —School Library Journal
(starred review) This profoundly moving memoir is the remarkable and
inspiring true story of Sandra Uwiringiyimana, a girl from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo who tells the tale of how she survived a massacre,
immigrated to America, and overcame her trauma through art and activism.
Sandra was just ten years old when she found herself with a gun pointed at
her head. She had watched as rebels gunned down her mother and six-year-old
sister in a refugee camp. Remarkably, the rebel didn’t pull the trigger,
and Sandra escaped. Thus began a new life for her and her surviving family
members. With no home and no money, they struggled to stay alive.
Eventually, through a United Nations refugee program, they moved to
America, only to face yet another ethnic disconnect. Sandra may have
crossed an ocean, but there was now a much wider divide she had to
overcome. And it started with middle school in New York. In this memoir,
Sandra tells the story of her survival, of finding her place in a new
country, of her hope for the future, and how she found a way to give voice
to her people.",0,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8185372-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.0899108063287168, 'Anticipation': 0.13078750392183228, 'Disgust': 0.036775581551700964, 'Fear': 0.14817802877504374, 'Joy': 0.1985119447806015, 'Sadness': 0.10523956792613508, 'Surprise': 0.04744296535341312, 'Trust': 0.24315360136255665}","{'Anger': 0.028016564130138755, 'Anticipation': 0.04708766000237428, 'Disgust': 0.0114594171828409, 'Fear': 0.04617286192135529, 'Joy': 0.056612733151304793, 'Sadness': 0.03083079028777731, 'Surprise': 0.015984525247728712, 'Trust': 0.07249949371861929, 'Objective': 0.6913359543578605}"

James were two of the lucky babies from 1% of the population randomly
selected to receive genetic engineering. Known as the ""Ones,"" this
generation of genetically enhanced teenagers is excelling. Cody, James, and
their fellow Ones are healthy, beautiful, talented...and to some, that's

creation of the Equality Movement, which quickly gains enough traction to
outlaw future genetic engineering--and demote the Ones to second-class

through her window. It bears a clear message: the darkest impulses of
society have been unleashed, and the Ones are the targets. As their school,
the government, and even family and friends turn against them, Cody begins
to believe they have no other choice but to protect their own. She draws
closer to a group of radical Ones led by the passionate and fevered Kai,

It was the same every morning. Wake up, grab the ice skates, and head to the rink while the world was still dark. Weekends were spent in glitter and tights at competitions. Perform. Smile. And do it again. She was good. She won. And she hated it. For ten years, figure skating was Tillie Walden's life. She woke before dawn for morning lessons, went straight to group practice after school, and spent weekends competing at ice rinks across the state. Skating was a central piece of her identity, her safe haven from the stress of school, bullies, and family. But as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls. The more Tillie thought about it, the more Tillie realized she'd outgrown her passion--and she finally needed to find her own voice.""]",395,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9144916-L.jpg,"{'Anger': 0.0707395498392283, 'Anticipation': 0.21527215526614082, 'Disgust': 0.009947026301788151, 'Fear': 0.03923292234379699, 'Joy': 0.28663628582664413, 'Sadness': 0.05526382752319045, 'Surprise': 0.05982095352656781, 'Trust': 0.2630872793726433}","{'Anger': 0.032958268667011556, 'Anticipation': 0.09735514743921368, 'Disgust': 0.003459648215209519, 'Fear': 0.018279013623038458, 'Joy': 0.1317684083462666, 'Sadness': 0.02473486808070357, 'Surprise': 0.0248426452836696, 'Trust': 0.11693826521814102, 'Objective': 0.549663735126746}"

From the author of the acclaimed American Booksellers Association’s Indies Introduce pick Salvage, which was called “Brilliant, feminist science fiction” by Stephanie Perkins, the internationally bestselling author of Anna and the French Kiss. This stand-alone action-adventure story is perfect for fans of Oryx and Crake and The House of the Scorpion.  Seventeen-year-old Tempest Torres has lived on the AgraStar farm north of Atlanta, Georgia, since she was found outside its gates at the age of five. Now she’s part of the security force guarding the fence and watching for scavengers—people who would rather steal genetically engineered food from the Company than work for it. When a group of such rebels accidentally sets off an explosion in the research compound, it releases into the air a blight that kills every living thing in its path—including humans. With blight-resistant seeds in her pocket, Tempest teams up with a scavenger boy named Alder and runs for help. But when they finally arrive at AgraStar headquarters, they discover that there’s an even bigger plot behind the blight—and it’s up to them to stop it from happening again.  Inspired by current environmental issues, specifically the genetic adjustment of seeds to resist blight and the risks of not allowing natural seed diversity, this is an action-adventure story that is Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake meets Nancy Farmer’s House of the Scorpion.",392,,"{'Anger': 0.09969495783240626, 'Anticipation': 0.1480172259106406, 'Disgust': 0.07975955499730845, 'Fear': 0.18785214426700156, 'Joy': 0.10242239368383274, 'Sadness': 0.12110174053472098, 'Surprise': 0.09879777498654224, 'Trust': 0.16235420778754706}","{'Anger': 0.03857556464323158, 'Anticipation': 0.06085579987363656, 'Disgust': 0.030861840323823678, 'Fear': 0.07268675058495162, 'Joy': 0.03783960174687042, 'Sadness': 0.0400891487131064, 'Surprise': 0.038228412333627254, 'Trust': 0.06293177068507037, 'Objective': 0.6179311110956821}"

Some are big, like the fact that her father may be having an affair. And then there’s the one that she can barely even admit to herself—the one about how she might have a crush on her best friend.  When Sana and her family move to California, she begins to wonder if it’s finally time for some honesty, especially after she meets Jamie Ramirez. Jamie is beautiful and smart and unlike anyone Sana’s ever known.  There are just a few problems: Sana's new friends don't trust Jamie's crowd; Jamie's friends clearly don't want her around anyway; and a sweet guy named Caleb seems to have more-than-friendly feelings for her.
