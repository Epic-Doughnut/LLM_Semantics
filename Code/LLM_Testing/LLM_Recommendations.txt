Based on the descriptions, I would recommend the following five book titles that would be suitable for a reader of the same estimated age as the one who read the original books:

The Giver, The City of Ember, The Hunger Games, Divergent, The Maze Runner

These books are all popular young adult dystopian novels that explore themes of self-discovery, rebellion, and survival, which are likely to appeal to readers of the same age group as the original books.
